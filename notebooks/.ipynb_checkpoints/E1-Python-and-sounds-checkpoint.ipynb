    "# Exercise 1: Python and sounds\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise aims to get familiar with some basic audio operations using Python. There are four parts to it: 1) Reading an audio file, 2) Basic operations with audio, 3) Python array indexing, and 4) Downsampling audio - Changing the sampling rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing the exercise, please go through the general information for all the exercises given in `README.txt` of the `notebooks` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "__Python:__ Python is a powerful and easy to learn programming language, which is used in a wide variety of application areas. More information in https://www.python.org/. We will use python in all the exercises and in this first one you will start learning about it by performing some basic operations with sound files. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Jupyter notebooks:__ Jupiter notebooks are interactive documents containing live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. More information in https://jupyter.org/. It supports Python and all the exercises here use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Wav file:__ The wav file format is a lossless format to store sounds on a hard drive. Each audio sample is stored as a 16 bit integer number (sometimes also as 24 bit integer or 32 bit float). In this course we will work with only one type of audio files. All the sound files we use in the assignments should be wav files that are mono (one channel), in which the samples are stored in 16 bits, and that use (most of the time) the sampling rate of 44100 Hz. Once read into python, the samples will be converted to floating point values with a range from -1 to 1, resulting in a one-dimensional array of floating point values."

    "The `read_audio_samples()` function bellow should read an audio file and return a specified number of consecutive samples of the file starting at a given sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the function is the file name (including the path), plus the location of first sample and the number of consecutive samples to take, and the output should be a numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the `wavread()` function from the `utilFunctions` module available in the `software/models` directory, the input samples will be automatically converted to a numpy array of floating point numbers with a range from -1 to 1, which is what we want. \n",
